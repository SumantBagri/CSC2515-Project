#Simple Image classification using SVM with feature extraction and selection.

##Papers:
    (SVM - Vapnik et al.,)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00994018]

##Dataset:
    (MNIST fashion)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist]
    (CIFAR10)[https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html]

##Baseline: 
    CNN are state of the art

##What we will do:
    - Simple SVM.
    - With feature extraction or selection - Recursive feature elimination, something else???
        - SVM with autoencoder
        - SVM + RFE
        - SVM + Relief = https://medium.com/@yashdagli98/feature-selection-using-relief-algorithms-with-python-example-3c2006e18f83

    - Compare performance & training time of SVM models with CNN
